# Cordova Instagram Assets Picker Plugin :camera: :video_camera: :scissors:

This is a cordova plugin for iOS that provides an image picker like Instagram, allowing you to crop photo and video with GPUImage.

![GIF](example.gif)

The app in the GIF shows how to use the [cordova-plugin-video-editor](https://github.com/jbavari/cordova-plugin-video-editor) and is using this plugin.  [Here is a YouTube video showing more of it](https://youtu.be/U0O2gG4N0JM).  [Here is the source code for the app shown in the gif and video](https://github.com/rossmartin/video-editor-ionic2).

## Installation
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-instagram-assets-picker
```
`InstagramAssetsPicker` will be available globally after deviceready.

To install the latest code from this repo (may be unstable) -
```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/rossmartin/cordova-plugin-instagram-assets-picker.git
```

#### You may have to update your Xcode project Header Search Paths manually
If you see `Could not locate build.xcconfig, you will need to set HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS manually.` in the CLI output when adding the plugin you will need to add an entry to your Xcode project Header Search Paths.  I have this step automated but for some reason it isn't working for everyone.  To do this navigate to your project Build Settings and add `"$(SRCROOT)/$(PRODUCT_NAME)/cordova-plugin-instagram-assets-picker/GPUImageHeaders"` to your Header Search Paths.  See the screenshot below for reference -

## Usage

### Show the picker with videos, photos, or all media

``` javascript
InstagramAssetsPicker.getMedia(
  function(result) { // success cb
    console.log('getMedia success, result: ', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
    // result will be an object with at least a phAssetId, filePath, and type property
    // you will only get the rect object when 'cropAfterSelect' is false
    // the rect object is required for the cropAsset function documented below

    /* example of result when the 'cropAfterSelect' option is set to false
    {
      phAssetId: "A1785F1A-EF0F-458C-9AF9-C439981CE0FB/L0/001",
      type: "video",
      rect: {
        Width: 0.5625000293366611,
        Height: 0.9999999823048711,
        Y: 0,
        X: 0.2496093880181434
      },
      filePath: "file:///Users/rossmartin/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/6465544C-C262-4EA8-BA7C-8BAB4AB98597/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/IMG_0006.m4v"
    }
    */
  },
  function(err) { // error cb
    console.log('getMedia error, err: ', err);
  },
  { // options
    type: 'video', // accepts 'photo', 'video', or 'all' - defaults to all
    cropAfterSelect: false, // see the note above for when this is false - defaults to false
    showGrid: false // determines whether to show the grid for cropping - defaults to false
  }
);
```

#### A note about the cropAfterSelect option with getMedia
The reason this option exists is to provide a better user experience.  It takes time to crop an asset with GPUImage so in most cases for a better UX you'll want to call `cropAsset` later with the result from the `getMedia` function.  This also allows showing your own UI loading indicator while the cropping is being performed.

#### A note about cropping using getMedia or cropAsset
The iOS simulator will not finish a crop using `getMedia` (with `cropAfterSelect` set to `true`) or `cropAsset`.  It works fine on a device.  I will be looking into why it doesn't work on the simulator.

### Crop a media asset from the device library
```javascript
InstagramAssetsPicker.cropAsset(
  function(result) { // success cb
    // result is an object with a filePath and type property
    console.log('cropAsset success, result: ', result);
    /* example of result
    {
      type: "video",
      filePath: "file:///Users/rossmartin/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/6465544C-C262-4EA8-BA7C-8BAB4AB98597/data/Media/DCIM/100APPLE/IMG_0006.m4v"
    }
    */
  },
  function(err) { // error cb
    console.log('cropAsset error, err: ', err);
  },
  { // options, both properties below are required
    phAssetId: "A1785F1A-EF0F-458C-9AF9-C439981CE0FB/L0/001",
    rect: {
      Width: 1,
      Height: 0.5625,
      Y: 0.249609375,
      X: 0
    }
  }
);
```
